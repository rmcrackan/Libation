> [!NOTE] Be aware of
>
> - **File Size**: The application has a large file size.
> - **Design**: Made by a programmer, not a designer. The goals are function rather than beauty.
> - **Support**: This is a single-developer personal passion project. Support, response, updates, enhancements, bug fixes, etc., are as my free time allows.
> - **Updates**: I have a full-time job, a life, and a finite attention span. Therefore, a lot of time can potentially go by with no improvements of any kind.

> [!WARNING] Disclaimer
> I've made every good-faith effort to include nothing insecure, malicious, anti-privacy, or destructive. That said: **use at your own risk**. I made this for myself and I want to share it with the great programming and audible/audiobook communities which have been so generous with their time and help.
