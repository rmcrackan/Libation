# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: What's the difference between 'Classic' and 'Chardonnay'?

**A:** First and most importantly: Classic and Chardonnay have the exact same features.

* **Classic** is Windows only. Its older 'grey boxes' look has a compact design which allows for more information on the screen. Notably, Classic was written using an older, more mature technology which has built-in support for screenreaders.

* **Chardonnay** is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Its modern design has a more open look and feel.

## Q: Now that I've downloaded my books, how can I listen to them?

**A:** You can use any app which plays m4b files (or mp3 files if you used that setting). Here are just a few ideas. Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with any of these companies:

## Q: How do I use Libation with a South Africa account?

**A:** Like many countries, amazon gives South Africa it's own amazon site. [Unlike many other regions](https://www.audible.com/ep/country-selector) there is not South Africa specific audible site. Use `US` for your region -- ie: audible.com.
