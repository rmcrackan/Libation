# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between 'Classic' and 'Chardonnay'?**

**A:** First and most importantly: Classic and Chardonnay have the exact same features.

* **Classic** is Windows only. Its older 'grey boxes' look has a compact design which allows for more information on the screen. Notably, Classic was written using an older, more mature technology which has built-in support for screenreaders.

* **Chardonnay** is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Its modern design has a more open look and feel.

**Q: Now that I've downloaded my books, how can I listen to them?**

**A:** You can use any app which plays m4b files (or mp3 files if you used that setting). Here are just a few ideas. Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with any of these companies:
